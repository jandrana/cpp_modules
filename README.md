# 42 C++ Modules

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the C++ modules from the 42 cursus, focusing on essential programming concepts like object-oriented programming, memory management, inheritance, polymorphism, and more. Each module introduces new C++ concepts, progressively building a strong foundation in the language.

## Repository Structure
Each module has its dedicated folder and README, providing context and guidance on its specific concepts and exercises.

### Module 00: Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, and Basic Concepts
- **Topics:** Namespaces, basic I/O streams, classes, `static` and `const` keywords.
- **Exercises:** [Megaphone, My Awesome PhoneBook, The Job of Your Dreams]

### Module 01: Memory Allocation, Pointers, and References
- **Topics:** Memory management, pointers, references, `switch` statement.
- **Exercises:** [BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ, Moar brainz!, HI THIS IS BRAIN, Unnecessary violence, Sed is for losers, Harl 2.0, Harl filter]

### Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Class Form
- **Topics:** Canonical class form, operator overloading, fixed-point numbers.
- **Exercises:** [My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form, Towards a More Useful Fixed-Point Number Class, Now We’re Talking, BSP]

### Module 03: Inheritance
- **Topics:** Class inheritance, constructor chaining, derived classes.
- **Exercises:** [Aaaaand... OPEN!, Serena, my love!, Repetitive work, Now it’s weird!]
